# Getting started

The Oasis Protocol is built on top of the Ethereum blockchain and includes all of the contracts for the OTC Market. The entire trading process does not require an operator and is non-custodial. The official user interfaces [OasisDex](http://oasis.app) and [Oasis Instant](https://oasis.app/instant) made by the MakerDAO Foundation, allows users of all skill level to interact with the smart contract easily. The maker-otc is a simple on-chain market for ERC20 tokens. 

The repository contains implementations of the protocol to exchange ERC20-compliant tokens using a fully decentralized, on-chain order book and matching engine. [OasisDex](http://oasis.app) maintains several token pairs with DAI as a quote currency, but anyone (individual or project) is allowed to create an alternative frontend that uses the smart contract. The protocol is used by [OasisDex](http://oasis.app), as well as many other DeFi projects within the ecosystem like:
